Hello! At Stanford University, there are several undergraduate programs available. Three of Stanfordâ€™s seven schools award undergraduate degrees: Humanities and Sciences; Engineering; and the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. Undergraduates complete at least 180 units, including major courses, writing and rhetoric requirements, and one year of a foreign language. All undergraduates also complete their Ways of Thinking / Ways of Doing general education requirements: 11 courses in 8 interdisciplinary Ways categories. You can find more information about undergraduate programs at Stanford University [here](https://facts.stanford.edu/academics/undergraduate/).
